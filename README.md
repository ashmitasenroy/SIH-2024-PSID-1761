# 🎯 AI-Based Time Slot Prediction Model – Smart India Hackathon 2024

Welcome to our AI-powered solution developed for **Smart India Hackathon 2024**, aimed at solving one of the real-world problem statements using predictive intelligence.

This project leverages historical data and advanced machine learning techniques to **predict optimal time slots** for processes, appointments, or sessions – ensuring efficiency, reduced wait times, and smart decision-making.

---

## 🚀 What this project solves

- Manual scheduling is inefficient.
- Peak hours create congestion.
- Lack of data-driven decisions leads to poor resource use.

Our model fixes this by predicting time slots using intelligent data analysis and forecasting techniques, which can easily be integrated into real-world appointment systems.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📊 Predicts time slots based on historical usage.
- 🤖 AI model trained on real data.
- 💡 Fast API for predictions.
- 🧠 Supports scalability for large datasets.
- ⚙️ Easily customizable and deployable.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** for ML model development
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** for data processing and ML
- **FastAPI** for API endpoints
- **Git + GitHub** for version control
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model experimentation
